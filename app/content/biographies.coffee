    bio: "A science team member of the Galaxy Zoo project whose research interests revolve around what causes galaxies to start and to stop forming stars.  She is interested in galaxies that have suddenly stopped forming stars (aka ‘post-starburst’ galaxies) and blue spheroidal galaxies. Therefore, she is very keen to find out how the massive radio jets emitting from central supermassive black holes affect its host galaxy as well as neighbouring galaxies."

For the Radio Zoo project in its beta phase, Enno has generated the radio contour and infrared heatmap images from the original FITS data."

As a sideline, he also researches the astronomy of Australian Aboriginal people, frequently appears on radio and TV, and has recently published a novel, Graven Images. His current all-consuming task is to lead the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) project to image the faintest radio galaxies in the Universe, using the new ASKAP radio telescope being built in Western Australia. EMU will multiply mankind’s knowledge of the radio sky from about 2.5 million radio sources to about 70 million, but to turn that data into understanding will require us to cross-match them against images from optical and infrared telescopes."

Larry's research work has focussed on radio galaxies, clusters of galaxies and supernova remnants, combining data from many different wavebands. He was a frequent on-screen expert for U.S. Public Television's  &quot;Newton’s Apple,&quot; and has been heavily involved in training elementary school teachers to use hand’s on science and in working with local planetariums."

As a result, he’s particularly excited about RadioQuest. As a postdoctoral researcher at UMN, he led the analysis and reduction of the Galaxy Zoo 2 project as well as helping to design and implement new analysis tools for the Zooniverse volunteers. He’s interested in the connection between massive radio jets and the black holes producing them, and understanding the physics that bridge the gap between such massive spatial scales."

    bio: "Ivy wants to know what causes galaxies to start and stop forming stars.  She suspects that radio jets might have some role in this. Ivy is particularly interested in galaxies that have suddenly stopped forming stars (aka ‘post-starburst’ galaxies) and blue spheroidal galaxies."

By comparing them, Melanie tried to understand where the different types of shapes come from and what are the effects on the galaxies that host the radio jets.  But most of all, she enjoyed explaining to anyone who would hear why this is so very cool and is excited to share this with you.  She is now working in education."
